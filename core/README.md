This is the least interesting package in the Goal libraries, and serves simply
to re-export existing libraries and provide essential utility factors in a
manner that is compatible with Goal. Nevertheless, there are a few modules worth
highlighting.

**Goal.Core.Circuit**: Provides an implementation of monadic Mealy automata to
facilitate simple stream-based processing.

**Goal.Core.Vector.Storable**: Combines the
[vector-sized](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-sized) and
[hmatrix](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix) libraries to provide
efficient linear algebra with static sizes.
